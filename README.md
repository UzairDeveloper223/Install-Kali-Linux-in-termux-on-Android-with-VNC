I have developed a script aimed at simplifying the installation process of Kali Linux on Termux. To begin, 
run this 
# `apt update && apt upgrade`
ensure you have Git installed using the command 
# `apt install git`
. Once Git is in place, the next step involves cloning the installation script from the provided GitHub repository. Execute 
# `git clone https://github.com/UzairDeveloper223/Install-Kali-Linux-in-termux-on-Android-with-VNC.git`
to retrieve the script. Subsequently, grant execute permissions to the script with 
# cd Install-Kali-Linux-in-termux-on-Android-with-VNC
by entering the upper command you will be directed to my script directory
now eneter the next command
down command make the script executable
# `chmod +x 'Install Kali.sh'`.
Finally, initiate the installation by running 
# `./'Install Kali.sh'`.
These steps streamline the process, making it accessible for users to seamlessly install Kali Linux on their Termux environment.
