You can install Kali Linux in termux on Android with VNC from here
copy the Highlights and paste into termux
I have developed a script aimed at simplifying the installation process of Kali Linux on Termux. To begin, 
run this 
# `apt update && apt upgrade`
ensure you have Git installed using the command 
# `apt install git`
. Once Git is in place, the next step involves cloning the installation script from the provided GitHub repository. Execute 
# `git clone https://github.com/UzairDeveloper223/INSTALL-KALI-Linux-on-Android-/blob/main/Installkali.sh`
to retrieve the script. Subsequently, grant execute permissions to the script with 
# `chmod +x Installkali.sh`.
Finally, initiate the installation by running 
# `./Installkali.sh`.
These steps streamline the process, making it accessible for users to seamlessly install Kali Linux on their Termux environment.
